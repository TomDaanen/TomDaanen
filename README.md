- 👋 Hi, I'm Tom! I joined the company on September 1st of this year and will take care of any Dutch marketing and Help Center translations.
- 👀 I’m interested in music/reading, travelling, (long distance) cycle trips, learning French (and improving my German).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to manoeuvre my bicycle in Leipzig without getting caught in accidents and I'm really interested in UX writing.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything if you think my contribution is valuable - or if I can make a difference. Just get in touch! :)
- 📫 Simply leave me a message on Slack or send me an email at tom.daanen@ivx.com. I'm looking forward to working with you!
